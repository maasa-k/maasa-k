# Hi, I'm Maasa!  ‚∏ú(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )‚∏ù‚ô°

## A bit about me...

üëã Software Engineer here! The last 2 years have been spent working with a remote front-end team building new features, fixing bugs, reducing technical debt, and adding test coverage (unit tests, acceptance tests, and visual regression) for a complex community engagement web application. In this capacity, I have been able to sharpen essential programming skills, including debugging, pair programming, understanding legacy code, and independent research. Although primarily front-end focused, I have also dabbled in some of the back-end PHP/Laravel code as well.

Previously, I spent a brief time as a contractor, making e-commerce websites accessible according to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards. This experience was invaluable, as it has shaped me into a more thoughtful coder, keeping all types of users in mind when writing code and testing functionality in the UI.

Cybersecurity is another territory that I am deeply interested in ([Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/), an eye-opening podcast filled with incredible stories in various cyber and physical security spaces, has fueled my interest - I'd highly recommend it).  Some of my spare time is spent educating myself on how to keep digital information secure.

On another note üéµ - I am a vocalist and have recently begun producing music with Ableton (prior to that, I used Logic), a completely different type of problem-solving. I collaborate with artists all over the world, a real treat and honor! If you'd like to have a listen to some of the music I have created - both my own and collaborations - you can find them on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1zUvpb0ikNsCGjZjUDoU4u) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/utaimoss).
