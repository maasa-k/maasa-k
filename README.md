**ABOUT ME**

I'm a Software Engineer who has come to relish the satisfaction of working through challenging code, making sense of things that didn't before. User experience is at the forefront of my mind while fixing bugs or working on new features, and maintaining a healthy developer experience is also important to me, as I strive to keep my code clean and readable for my teammates.

Always hungry for growth and seeking ways to make a positive impact!
